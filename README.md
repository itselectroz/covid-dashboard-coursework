## Installing

Installing the dashboard is simple.

Ensure pip is up to date  

    python -m pip install â€“upgrade pip

Install the required pip modules using the following command

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running

Running the dashboard is easy. You have two options;

- Using the main module
- Flask's CLI

### Main Module

Assuming you have python installed simply run

    python src/__main__.py

### Flask CLI

First you need to export the necessary variables

***

#### CMD

`set FLASK_APP="src/__main__.py"`

#### Powershell

`$env:FLASK_APP="src/__main__.py"`

#### Bash

`export FLASK_APP="src/__main__.py"`

***

Then run the app using

    flask run

This will start the interface at `127.0.0.1:5000/index` which can simply be navigated to with any web browser.

## Config File
